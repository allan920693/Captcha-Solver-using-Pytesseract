# Captcha-Solver-using-Pytesseract

This project shows how to use pytesseract package (OCR, Optical Character Recognition) to solve Captcha. 

OCR requires parameter tuning based on its image pattern.

We demonstrate how to use image pre-processing and then utilize tesseract package to recognize captcha.

The accuracy of proposed method can achieve up to 80%, which is acceptable for many web applications.
